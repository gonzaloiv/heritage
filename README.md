## About

Little project for the 28th edition of Ludum Dare based on the topic proposed: *A small world*.

Developed in Unity, using the library [2D Light of Sight] (https://github.com/f15gdsy/2D-Light-of-Sight-Unity). It contains vectors from [Freepik] (http://www.freepik.es/) and the font Gwibble from [DaFont] (http://www.dafont.com/es/gwibble.font). I've used illustrator for the graphics, Ableton Live for the music and Bfxr for the SFXs.

## Instructions

Use your mouse to translate (X axis) and rotate (Y axis) the world.

Modes:
- Collect: you score for every monument on the world.
- Destroy: you score for every collision of two monuments of the same type.
